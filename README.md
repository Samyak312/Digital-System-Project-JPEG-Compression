**Color Space Conversion**
Convert the image from RGB to YCbCr color space. This separates the image into luminance (Y) and chrominance (Cb and Cr) components, exploiting the human eye's insensitivity to color as compared to brightness.

**Downsampling**
Reduce the resolution of chrominance channels (Cb and Cr) by averaging neighboring pixels into larger blocks, typically by a factor of 2 in both horizontal and vertical directions.

**Division into 8x8 Pixel Blocks**
Divide the image into smaller 8x8 pixel blocks. This segmentation allows for parallel processing and simplifies subsequent compression steps.

**Forward Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**
The Forward Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is a fundamental step in JPEG compression, responsible for converting spatial domain pixel values into frequency domain coefficients. This transformation helps to decorrelate the pixel values within each 8x8 block, leading to more efficient compression by concentrating the image energy into fewer coefficients. Understanding the Forward DCT involves grasping the mathematical principles behind the transformation, including how cosine basis functions are applied to the pixel data and how the resulting coefficients represent the frequency content of the image.

**Quantization**
Quantization is a lossy compression technique used to reduce the precision of the DCT coefficients. In this step, the frequency domain coefficients obtained from the Forward DCT are divided by a quantization matrix. This matrix contains predefined values that determine the level of compression applied to different frequency components of the image. High-frequency components, which represent fine details, are quantized more aggressively, leading to greater compression. Understanding quantization involves understanding how the quantization matrix influences the compression ratio and perceived image quality, as well as the trade-off between compression and loss of image fidelity.

**Entropy Encoding**
Entropy encoding is the final step in the JPEG compression process, responsible for encoding the quantized DCT coefficients into a compact binary representation for storage or transmission. The two main techniques used in JPEG entropy encoding are Run-Length Encoding (RLE) and Huffman Coding. RLE is applied to exploit the presence of long sequences of zeros in the quantized coefficient matrices, reducing redundancy and further compressing the data. Huffman Coding assigns variable-length codes to the remaining non-zero coefficients based on their frequency of occurrence, ensuring that more common values are represented using shorter codes. Understanding entropy encoding involves grasping the principles of RLE and Huffman Coding, as well as their application to efficiently represent the compressed image data.
